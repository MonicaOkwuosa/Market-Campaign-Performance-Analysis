# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis
As a Data Analysis, i used Power BI for the data cleaning, exploration and visualization of the marketing dataset to provide actionable insights for optimizing campaign efectiveness.

## 1. Introduction
This report presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of our marketing campaign dataset using Power BI.
The dataset comprises detailed campaign information, including campaign ID, company, campaign type, target audience, duration, channel used, conversion rate, acquisition cost, ROI, location, date, clicks, impressions, engagement score, and customer segment.
The objective is to uncover actionable insights regarding campaign performance, channel effectiveness, audience engagement, and overall return on investment. Through a systematic analysis, we aim to inform future marketing strategies with data-driven recommendations. 

## 2. Objectives
The task breakdown includes:
●	Data Understanding
●	Initial Data Exploration to identify which channels and audience segments deliver the best ROI. 
●	Evaluate the performance of different marketing campaigns.
●	Insight Generation for future campaign planning and resource allocation
●	Data visualization 

## 3. Power BI Analysis Summary
Key Observations:
a.	Campaign Performance:
• Certain campaign types consistently exhibit higher conversion rates, targeted digital campaigns tend to underperform broad-based advertising efforts and influencing.
 • Campaigns with shorter durations (15 - 45 days) have shown a surprisingly high engagement score, suggesting that concise, time-sensitive promotions might be more effective.
b.	Channel Effectiveness:
 •  Influencer and Search channels are leading in engagement and conversion, whereas social media and Email channels show lower conversions.
 • The data indicates that a multi-channel approach—when optimized—can improve overall campaign performance by leveraging the strengths of each channel.
c.	 Customer Segmentation:
 • Foodies and Tech Enthusiasts customer segments show higher responsiveness, evidenced by higher click-through, ROI and conversion rates.
 • Outdoor adventures and Tech Enthusiasts segment can be leveraged to produce more Click through rate (CTR) and ROI.  
d.	Cost Efficiency:
 • There is a notable variance between acquisition cost and ROI across campaigns. Some campaigns with higher acquisition costs still deliver superior ROI, emphasizing the importance of channel and content quality over mere spending.
e.	ROI analysis: 
• ROI was the same across all channels except Facebook with a slightly lesser ROI.
• ROI was the same across all customer segment and locations.
f.	Location Analysis
• Chicago and New York had the best Conversion rates although the difference is minimal, more optimization of these locations would yield greater conversion rates and ROI.
These insights provide a foundation for refining our marketing strategies to focus on high-performing segments and channels.

## 4. Methodology Overview
 • Data Acquisition & Preparation: I began by importing the dataset and performing initial cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
 • Exploratory Analysis: Descriptive statistics and visualization techniques (such as bar charts, line graphs and pie charts) were employed to understand distributions, correlations, and trends.
 • Analysis Tools: Power BI and DAX functions were used for data manipulation and visualization.

 ## 5. Visualization 
 The dashboard included:
